#	[Uno Game]



## Introduction :

During the highschool in 2022, i had to develop my second O.O.D based game.
I was again with my partner Amine Belhaj and we worked on this project for below than 1 month only. 
So we used to manage our stress due to the pression of our teacher and the deadline !


## What about this game :

Uno is a childish card game to play against unlimited players. This game is very intuitive that even a baby can play ! 
Actually, the cards have only 2 properties : color and number. 
There are also specials cards but the rules about those differ according to players.


## A little look of the UI of the game :
